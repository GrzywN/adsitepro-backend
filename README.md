# An recruitment task for adsite.pro company.

## Task

Get ready for an exciting adventure! :)

__Technologies:__
- Backend: Laravel (PHP)
- Frontend: Vue.js + Tailwind CSS

__Assumptions:__

You are to create a simple TO-DO application for task creation. In the application, the user will be able to create task categories and then add tasks to them. When creating a task, the user should be able to assign a person to it from the available application users and specify how many minutes it will take to complete the task. Each person has a 9600-minute limit, which resets on the 1st day of the month.

__Finally, the application should allow:__
- Managing users
- Adding task categories and tasks

The rest is up to your creativity.

We will primarily evaluate the quality of the code, and to a lesser extent, the appearance of the application.
